# Excecutive Summary
This repository for tutorial how to setup MASM and Irvine Library in Visual Studio. 
This assembly languange using X64 Processor Architecture  and using Visual Studio 2019. Assembly languange is a great tool for learning how a computer works, and it requires you to have a working knowledge of computer hardware. The concept in this section will help to undertand the assembly language code that be written. For this situation to use  higher-level languages like C++ in Visual Studio, need to setup MASM and Irvine Library in Visual Studio before create the program


# What is Visual Studio
Microsoft's Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for creating computer programs, including websites, web apps, web services, and mobile apps. It uses Microsoft software development platforms like Windows API, Windows Forms, WPF, Microsoft Store, and Silverlight. It includes a code editor, integrated debugger, code profiler, and other built-in tools. Visual Studio supports 36 programming languages, including C, C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic.NET, C#, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Additional languages like Python, Ruby, Node.js, and M are available via plug-ins. 


**MASM**
MASM stands for Microsoft Macro Assembler. It is an assembler that takes the x64 compiler language and builds it into object files that can be linked to your C++ code. This is useful because it allows developers to write highly optimized code or access low-level system functions directly which isn't possible with higher-level languages like C++.


**Irvine Library**
The Irvine library essentially acts as an intermediary between your assembly code and the operating system. When you call an Irvine library function in your code, it handles the underlying operating system interactions for you

# Reflection
For the reflection, it is very helpful to me a lot how to communicate with higher-level languages like C++ in Visual Studio 2019. It also helps me to understand the assembly language code that will be written. Now i have basic knowledge in programming C++; in future, i want to develop more understanding for other programming such as Python, HTML, Java, etc.
