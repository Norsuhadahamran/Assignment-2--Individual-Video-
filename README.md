# What is Visual Studio
Microsoft's Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for creating computer programs, including websites, web apps, web services, and mobile apps. It uses Microsoft software development platforms like Windows API, Windows Forms, WPF, Microsoft Store, and Silverlight. It includes a code editor, integrated debugger, code profiler, and other built-in tools. Visual Studio supports 36 programming languages, including C, C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic.NET, C#, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Additional languages like Python, Ruby, Node.js, and M are available via plug-ins. Visual Studio 2022 is currently production-ready.
